The demo shows:

1. Opening the session list with `cclog`
2. Navigating through sessions with real-time preview
3. Resuming a Claude Code session with `Ctrl-R`

## Installation

### Using Sheldon (Recommended)

Add to your `~/.config/sheldon/plugins.toml`:

```toml
[plugins.cclog]
github = "choplin/cclog"
```

Then run:

```bash
sheldon lock --update
```

### Manual Installation (bash/zsh)

Works with both bash and zsh:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/choplin/cclog.git
```

Add to your shell configuration:

```bash
# For bash/zsh
source /path/to/cclog/cclog.sh

# For zsh with plugin managers (oh-my-zsh, etc)
# The cclog.plugin.zsh will be loaded automatically
```

<summary>Other Plugin Managers</summary>

> **Note:** These methods haven't been tested but should work thanks to the standard `.plugin.zsh` file structure. Please open an issue if you encounter any problems!

#### Oh-My-Zsh

```bash
git clone https://github.com/choplin/cclog ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/cclog
```

Then add `cclog` to the plugins array in your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
plugins=(... cclog)
```

#### Zinit

```bash
zinit load choplin/cclog
```

#### Zplug

```bash
zplug "choplin/cclog"
```

#### Antigen

antigen bundle choplin/cclog@main
```

#### Zgen

```bash
zgen load choplin/cclog
```

#### Antibody

```bash

```
